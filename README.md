# Text-Replacement
A simple Chrome extension that replaces text on webpages.

This exists because I wanted a Chrome extension that did text replacement in a trustworthy way.

Given that this extension reads the content of every webpage you visit, there is a security concern there if you don't trust the developer (or worry about the developer's account being hacked.)

Hence, I decied to write one myself to address those conerns.
